RAT iLQR
--------

The RAT iLQR algorithm is originally presented in our paper:

We used the following textbook as a reference to implement the Cross Entropy Method:

PETS
----

PETS is originally presented in the first paper. Note that we provide the MPC implementation but not the model-learning part. We referred to the second paper as well during the development of this software.
